# Prodigy Data Science Task 02 üìù


## Description

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.


## Introduction

The script utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status. It starts by loading the dataset and conducts data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and converting data types as necessary. Then, it explores the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics to identify insights and trends.


## Usage

- Ensure Python and required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed.
- Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the script.
- Run the script to execute data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- **Dataset Used** - [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
